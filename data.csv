Thomas More’s original coinage, suggesting both “good place” and “no place,” might give little cause for hope, but that hasn’t stopped visionaries, scientists, artists and scholars from seeking it out over the years. It might be in our past, or just ahead. We might be there now, if only we knew how to look: under the pavement, we might find the beach. Or utopia might be off our planet entirely. Ideals shape societies; scientific research, architecture, city planning and cultural production all attest to the hopes and values that spawned them. But as we consider the fallout of past utopian efforts, corollary questions present themselves: do we even want to find utopia? Does every “perfect” society imply a dystopian counterpart? Who is utopia for, and who is excluded? This course will explore utopia through the work of scientists, architects, artists and art movements. Classes will fall into three categories: lectures and reading discussions; field trips; and group art projects. These latter Learning Lab projects will encourage students to work together and apply the readings, discussions and artistic precedents towards their own visions of utopia.

Contests over “Who Should Vote?” have existed since the nation’s beginnings and continue today, as people argue over the prevalence of voter suppression or debate whether to lower the voting age. Studying historical contests over this “Big Question” is important because they illuminate the contingency of democracy. Democracy did not always mean the same thing to earlier Americans that it does to us. Moreover, expansions of the right to vote for some groups have often occurred hand in hand with new restrictions on voting for others. The history of suffrage is not one of unbroken progress or decline, but instead of continuous protest and political struggle. By exploring how earlier Americans fought over the answer to “Who Should Vote?"", students in this class will grapple with the meaning of American democracy itself.

WHAT is the Disney Corporation and how has it grown and evolved?WHY does the current configuration of Disney as global culture giant exist and why does it matter (in the lives of those it touches across the world, but also especially with regard to Disney's patents, copyrights and trademarks)?The course will cover the formation of Disney and its use of fairy tales and folk culture to build its narratives. It will cover the building of Disneyland and its utopian project of transforming theme parks and building a world around storytelling. It will cover the movement of Disney in the forefront of film production in the 1980s through its Touchstone imprint and through the utilization of digital animation technology. Finally, the course will discuss the current triumphal corporate world of Disney Plus, and the ownership of an immense set of copyrights, patents, and trademarks.

1049,"What is Hate?. Hate can be an emotion, an action, a belief, an ideology. It can manifest itself with great passion, or become normalized so that it isn’t even recognized as such –perhaps seen, instead, as an expression of “how things are.” This course gathers strands from diverse disciplines, in order to present a cohesive examination of “hate as a system” undermining civic life, and even the cultural and intellectual vitality of society. We will examine the unsettling question of “hatred” through scholarly works, literary expressions, and visual culture dealing with prejudice, discrimination, extreme nationalistic movements, racism, and genocide. Along with these academic and artistic explorations, we will advance into the realm of engaged humanities and activism, through a series of presentations by scholars and advocates. The class will benefit from presentations by faculty and guest speakers from our university (the Boniuk Institute for Religious Tolerance, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion), and the larger Houston community (Houston Coalition Against Hate, Anti-Defamation League, ACLU, etc.).

And what are its consequences for those whose bodies are exposed to that domination? How does the history of immunity inspire contemporary depictions of BIOPOC, trans, queer, and undocumented lives as pathogenic to the flourishing of “healthy” bodies and in turn to their state-sponsored exposure to death?

This class will take a historical perspective on the relationship between science and modernity with a particular focus on music—a topic which has puzzled philosophers for millennia, and one which poses special problems for the modes of knowledge that characterize scientific modernity. Is music a “universal language”? Why does music so powerfully affect our emotions? Why are some sounds pleasing and others are not? Our goal in this class is to explore what scientific approaches to these questions can tell us about the place of science in the modern world—as well as how and why science has become so important to our imagining of ourselves as thinking, feeling, and willing beings. Armed with this historical knowledge, we will also read recent examples of popular science writing on sound and music a way to think about how we can we become better consumers of scientific knowledge as it is disseminated in the public sphere.

We explore the way that colonial geographies imprint geographies of toxicity and the ways that capitalism and consumption produce and distribute toxicity. In relation to health, we explore the ways that the materiality and biology of toxic exposure are embodied in specific ways that undermine singular or universalizable concepts and measures of human and environmental health and require us to think about the health in relation to the specificities of race, class, gender, disability, and intimacy in particular places and times. In relation to sovereignty, we explore the ways that the promiscuous movement of toxicants provokes but also eludes regulations that hew to the ridged boundaries of law and territory and raise new questions of accountability and evidence.

In this class emphasis is placed on what the archaeological analyses of the material record reveal about slavery and the everyday lives of enslaved individuals, including plantation life, labor management of the planters, work habits of the enslaved, leisure time, economic networks, kinship, religious practices, retentions, and resistance, to name but a few.

In addition to identifying markers, scientific knowledge production around genetic information is reconstituting key ideas of risk, care, capital that impact our ideas of disability, race, kinship, citizenship, nationalism, and justice. In this class, our aim is to ask a) what is historically and materially distinct about genetic information as a metaphor for social processes, b) how is the value of life itself being reproduced and transformed for whom, and c) what are potential consequences we face by relating to one another through the geneticization of social life?

We explore the way that colonial geographies imprint geographies of toxicity and the ways that capitalism and consumption produce and distribute toxicity. In relation to health, we explore the ways that the materiality and biology of toxic exposure are embodied in specific ways that undermine singular or universalizable concepts and measures of human and environmental health and require us to think about the health in relation to the specificities of race, class, gender, disability, and intimacy in particular places and times. In relation to sovereignty, we explore the ways that the promiscuous movement of toxicants provokes but also eludes regulations that hew to the ridged boundaries of law and territory and raise new questions of accountability and evidence.

In this class emphasis is placed on what the archaeological analyses of the material record reveal about slavery and the everyday lives of enslaved individuals, including plantation life, labor management of the planters, work habits of the enslaved, leisure time, economic networks, kinship, religious practices, retentions, and resistance, to name but a few.

2890,"Description: Game theory is a discipline that provides a mathematical methodology for modeling and analyzing interactive decisions among multiple agents. Game theory has a wide range of applications in economics, political science, but most importantly (in my opinion) business. The approach of this course will be somewhere between that of a typical economics class (i.e. very mathematical) and that of a typical business seminar (applied and paper based.) Definitions will be stated formally, and arguments will be developed rigorously. At the same time, much of the course will be devoted to using game theory to understand applications in economics and business. Taking these applications as a starting point, we will develop an understanding of what constitutes a good mathematical model for addressing a business question.

2935,"Description: How does the brain work? Understanding the brain requires sophisticated theories to make sense of the collective actions of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses. Word theories are not enough; we need mathematical theories. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the mathematical theories of learning and computation by neural systems. These theories use concepts from dynamical systems (attractors, oscillations, chaos) and concepts from statistics (information, uncertainty, inference) to relate the dynamics and functions of neural networks. We will apply these theories to sensory computation, learning and memory, and motor control. Students will learn to formalize and mathematically answer questions about neural computations, including “what does a network compute?”, “how does it compute?”, and “why does it compute that way?”

3076,"Description: This course and its second part in the Spring semester will cover mathematical concepts that are at the heart of mathematical modeling in Chemical Engineering. Machine calculations are indispensable for studying the mathematical models in realistic applications, while classical, ana- lytical techniques applied to simplified models serve to strengthen one’s intuition. In this course, we will learn both the analytical techniques and also complementary numerical methods. For the latter part, programming literacy is essential. This requires gaining proficiency in (1) the programming language, an aspect that involves learning the grammar and the syntax of the language, and (2) computational thinking, an aspect that is independent of the programming language and is a skill that is broadly applicable to all problem solving and analysis. We will study all these aspects with applications in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. If registering for CHBE 302, you must register for CHBE 301.

Its root has extended into the modern day in various forms such as StarWars Lightsaber fights, in which Darth Vader lunges, parries, and attacks the opponent with lightsaber. Also its athletic presence has been augmenting as an Olympic sport and large global championships as fencing has proved to be more than just sword fights with its complex technicality and mental strategies.
While most sports do incorporate mental strategies into performance, fencing integrates these mental knowledge into performance simultaneously with body movements. How does this dual integration of psychological strategies and physical movements in fencing differentiate from other sports? In this course, students will go over fundamental principles of fencing, compare different types and rules of fencing, and discuss mental strategies along with the physical strategies observed in Olympic games that influence an individual's performance. Students will also be able to try practical tactics and styles in fencing and have a chance to attend one of Rice Fencing Club practices if social distancing regulations ameliorate.

Film adaptations of musicals, however, allow people to witness that theatre for a fraction of a Broadway ticket price, with one essential trade-off: the shift in storytelling medium requires changes to the source material that can lessen its quality dramatically. While some film adaptations are able to preserve, even enhance, the artistry of the original production, others handle the challenge much less gracefully. In “From Stage to Screen,” students will watch and discuss an assortment of film adaptations of musicals, ranging in critical acclaim and film style, in order to answer the question: considering the many definitions of success, what factors influence the artistic success of a film adaptation of a musical?

In this course, students will learn the mathematical basis of twisty puzzle behavior, predominant methods of solving the Rubik’s Cube (3x3) and Rubik’s Revenge (4x4), and ways of constructing solves and critiquing their efficiency. Students should expect to spend time each week practicing solves of the 3x3 and 4x4, commentating on the choices they make to solve increasingly large portions of these puzzles. Students will also regularly analyze solution methods for the 3x3 and 4x4, through both physical manipulation and computer simulation of twisty puzzles.

Do you think investing is for the old and wealthy? With the increasing precarity surrounding us, it is more important than ever to set yourself up for financial success. There is a common misconception in investing that you need a lot of money to get started. That is certainly not true anymore. All it takes is a plan. Learning how to invest is a skill that everyone can make use of. 
In this class, you will learn the basics of investing and account management. We will cover what the stock market is, how to invest, what stocks to pick, how to hedge, and the importance of investing your money. Starting to prepare for YOUR financial future is a luxury that many people wished they started doing in their early 20s. Over time, you will be able to generate more money through passive income than through a traditional office job, and this will be illustrated by the power of compound interest. We will discuss your needs as an individual financially and come up with an effective plan to meet those needs. We will also discuss something many mathematicians and investors have long debated – does technical analysis work? What are its limits, and when can you use it? Why should and why should it not work? By the end of the class, you will have the tools required to manage your own portfolio effectively and plan for your future and retirement.

When the election happened, a closer-than-expected Biden victory left many Americans with the same takeaways they had from 2016: that polls were broken, pundits had no clue what they were talking about, and Trump was impossible to analyze. This course will examine each of these assumptions. Talking about elections—especially this one—is an emotionally charged, partisan exercise. What can we learn from 2020 by analyzing the campaign while controlling for our emotions and partisan leanings? Each week, the class will cover one aspect of the election (race, COVID, debates, etc.) informed by readings: a combination of primary sources from the campaign and retrospective analysis of the topics’ effects.

At the core of this class is the question “how do I decide what move to make?”, which involves analyzing what information is known and unknown, imagining possible obstacles and outcomes, and prioritizing appropriate goals. Students will develop skills and strategy tools to answer this question through the lens of Pokémon.
The Pokémon games are turn-based strategy games where players create a team from a wide selection of characters and battle opponents with similarly constructed teams. Although typically this opponent is a simple AI, in a competitive context, human players battle each other. This increases the complexity of the game significantly. This course will focus on the “core series” of Pokémon video games for Nintendo handheld consoles, specifically the 8th and most recent installment of the series, Sword & Shield. The course will cover introductory mechanics and principles so that students with no prior experience won’t be lost, and at the end of the semester we will have an in-class tournament to apply skills gained.

In creating their own sets and styles, students will learn more about their own style of comedy and learn how to best use that to form a relationship with any potential audiences.

When brands and businesses profit off our lack of fulfillment and distraction in the material world just to sell us the next best product to fix whatever is wrong with us or to fill whatever need we have, we end up lacking the energy, will, and resources to discover who we are. In a world that constantly tugs you to and fro between trends, unreasonable standards, and crippling pressure and expectations, do you know who you are and who you want to be? How can we use astrology as a method of continual introspection to better understand and engage with ourselves and the world around us? In what ways can astrology as a field evolve to better support our individual and societal needs? Astrology provides a cosmic look into the person you were divinely created to be and how you interact with the world around you. We go beyond horoscopes and sun-signs, and begin to dig into the depths and complexities of astrology using birth/natal charts - how the heavens aligned with the planets and constellations at the exact moment of your birth. In this course, students will learn how to use astrology as a guide on their life paths, through defining astrological terms and applying this to their own natal charts. This gained knowledge of the self will provide both freedom and grounding to allow students to better navigate their world.

However, most of this information is either subjective or presents empathy as something that can be maximized with ten steps (and ten dollars). Subjective experience is a good starting point, but if we truly want to understand empathy, we need to answer the following question: what makes people empathize and why does empathy motivate them to help other people? In Empathy, students will take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding why people empathize. By exploring its psychological mechanisms, its neural correlates, how it is conveyed through language (semantics), and even computational recreations of it, students will be challenged to see empathy from a variety of perspectives.

3331,"Description: Beset by political and personal turmoil, the composer Pauline Oliveros retreated inward in the late 1960’s to develop listening techniques she called “Deep Listening” before returning to her public life as a composer. These techniques would become foundational to her musical life and the way she interacted with other people. What is it like to live with a listening practice that clears room for more than just our immediate goals? With no exams, this course will employ close readings of semi-improvisitory group exercises by Oliveros and solitary listening to explore the learned art of listening as both a social phenomenon and an individual journey, with an understanding of the many roles listening can play: a necessary pause before action, a blueprint for meaningful social interaction, a path toward healing.

3338,"Description: What constitutes “art cinema” and what advantages does it offer as a form of artistic expression? Arthouse films get their name from the “arthouse” cinemas they play in, as opposed to blockbuster theaters. But the key to an art film is that it is about the artistic vision of its director, as opposed to an entertaining formula. These types of films can sometimes be written off as pretentious or boring. However, they are an entirely unique visual and aural route to engage with ideas on human nature itself. A film like Parasite indicates the potential that they have to make mainstream splashes. Watching art cinema can and should be an entirely exciting experience. Throughout the semester, we will be looking at some of the most acclaimed arthouse films from various countries around the world, gaining an appreciation for their context in larger cinematic movements. Students will analyze the directorial choices in these films and explore if they are making any significant statements beyond the surface of the film. By the end of the course, we will all have heightened our appreciation of these movies as a tool for personal expression, and students will be motivated to further explore uncharted cinematic territory.

As a result, it is more important than ever to ensure that programs function correctly and cannot be exploited by hostile adversaries. The field of formal methods takes on this challenge, developing algorithms and programming methodologies that can be used to formally reason about what happens when software executes on arbitrary inputs, often without actually executing the program. Such reasoning can be used, for example, to identify subtle bugs and vulnerabilities in programs, or to give mathematical proofs of program correctness. This is a hands-on introduction to the field of formal methods. In this class, you will learn the theoretical foundations of these systems; you will also implement a series of systems that can be used to reason about the correctness of C programs.

Such reasoning can be used, for example, to identify subtle bugs and vulnerabilities in programs, or to give mathematical proofs of program correctness. This is a hands-on introduction to the field of formal methods. In this class, you will learn the theoretical foundations of these systems; you will also implement a series of systems that can be used to reason about the correctness of C programs.

3478,"Description: This course will overview both traditional and more recent graph-based machine learning
algorithms. Graphs show up in machine learning in many forms. Oftentimes, the input data can be naturally represented as a graph, such as for relational learning tasks applied to social
networks and graph kernels applied to chemical data. Other times, graphs are just a framework to express some intrinsic structure in the data, such as for graphical models and non-linear
embedding. In both cases, recent advances in representation learning (or graph embedding)
and deep learning have generated a renewed interest in machine learning on graphs. At the end of the course, students are expected to be able to: (1) identify the appropriate graph-based machine learning algorithm for a given problem; (2) extend existing algorithms to solve new related problems; and (3) recognize some of the key research challenges in the field.

3482,"Description: Recent advances in machine learning and robotics have led technology users, developers, and policymakers to increasingly consider the role of AI in social, economic, and political life.  Amid both utopian and dystopian visions for the potential of AI, important questions about the role of “artificial” intelligence in “human” society are newly emerging or being considered anew: what kinds of sociotechnical processes count as “AI”? What will be the moral status of “autonomous” entities? What will be the social, cultural, and political impact of AI? What will this impact be in different cultures and nations around the world? In this class, we will draw on a diverse set of historical and theoretical materials - including academic texts, historical analyses, technical reports, and science fiction film and literature - to examine the affordances and limitations of AI in areas such as education, manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, policing, and warfare. In so doing, the ultimate purpose of this course will be to deconstruct the epistemological, ontological, and ethical assumptions that have historically shaped and in many ways continue to shape the development of AI.

3501,"Description: Modern computer systems are designed and implemented in a layered fashion, wherein each layer builds upon those beneath it, providing abstractions for processing, memory, and I/O that are progressively more abstracted from the hardware and easier to use than those of the underlying layers.  While this layered architecture has made building systems easier, it has also made understanding their behavior and performance more difficult. Every layer from the managed run-time environments used by modern programming languages to the hypervisor play a role in processor scheduling, memory management, and I/O, making it oftentimes difficult to pinpoint which layer of the system is interacting poorly with a program.  This class will teach students about the fundamental characteristics of the abstractions for processing, memory, and I/O at each layer of a modern computer system, so that they might understand the functionality provided by each layer, and instruct them on the use of modern debugging, profiling, and tracing tools, so that they are equipped to characterize the behavior and performance of their programs.

(ii) The variational linearized or weak formulation of Earth's elastic-gravitational deformations. (iii) Energy estimates and well-posedness under appropriate conditions (that, for example, constrain the shapes of the major boundaries) of the system of elastic-gravitational equations describing the oscillations of the earth, and a Volterra equation justifying the extraction of the system describing acousto-elastic waves. (iv) The characterization of the spectrum of the earth, seismic normal modes and the essential spectrum associated with internal or gravity modes and embedded eigenfrequencies. The ``asympotic’' resolution of the identity or seismic normal mode summation.  In radial models such as PREM, a discussion of the Einstein-Brioullin-Keller quantization, trace formula and length spectrum. (v) Incorporation of dynamic ruptures, using rate- and state-dependent friction laws, generating seismic waves through an iterative coupling scheme and viscosity solutions. All parts will be illustrated with computational simulations using numerical formulations closely related to the analysis.

1.	Computational Geophysics
2.	Reservoir Simulation Fundamentals
3.	Machine Learning
The first two components will be taught together in the first 10 weeks by dedicating half of the class-time to each subject. The Machine Learning component will, in part, build on the first two fundamental components and will be taught using the full class time.
Computational Geophysics
The participants in this geophysics part of the course are expected to be interested into learn how to use modern seismic data to image the subsurface with awareness of the computational costs of the techniques involved. The main focus will be given to current seismic imaging tools including cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) applications. As the result of the successful completion of this course part, the course participants should be able to: (1) Understand the context and value of imaging tools for the hydrocarbon exploration business. (2) Relate the imaging tools with their computational costs for modern computer resources. (3) Properly use wave-based geophysical imaging and ML-based tools and (4) Understand main seismic processing and interpretation decisions.
Applied Reservoir Simulation
This component of the course will introduce participants to the practice of reservoir simulation. This class will be an applied course on reservoir simulation. Theoretical descriptions will be provided as warranted but will be kept to minimum. Class participants will learn about the fundamentals of applied reservoir simulation, use of a reservoir simulator, and how to select the proper model for a simulation study. This course will also cover data preparation, grid design, calibration of the reservoir model, forecasting of future performance, and interpretation of simulation results. Participants will also be introduced to the role of simulation in reservoir management, limitations of reservoir simulation, and the structural aspects of the models. Upscaling and recent advances simulation techniques will also be discussed. A realistic open-source reservoir simulation software will be used during the tutorials and computer projects.
Machine Learning for Oil & Gas
This part of the course will introduce the fundamentals of statistical learning, present a few of the popular learning paradigms and algorithms, and culminate in a small student project applying them to an oil reservoir data set using the R programming language (solutions to class problems will be accepted in any programming language or system). Much of the material presented here is also known under the names “Big Data”, “Data Analytics”, “Artificial Intelligence”, “Data Mining”, “Petroleum Data Driven Analytics” and other terms. Weeks 11 and 12 are theory only, weeks 13-15 will have small hands-on exercises incorporated and week 16 and 17 are dedicated to solving a simple oil reservoir problem using machine learning.

Such applications include for instance, weather prediction, air quality management, VLSI chip design, molecular dynamics, active noise reduction, chemical reactors, etc. In all these cases complexity manifests itself as the number of first order differential equations which arise. Model (order) reduction (MOR) seeks to replace a large-scale system described in terms of differential or difference equations by a system of much lower dimension that has nearly the same response characteristics. The ensuing methods have been an indispensable tool for speeding up the simulations arising in various engineering applications involving large-scale dynamical systems.

3914,"Description: How does the brain work? Understanding the brain requires sophisticated theories to make sense of the collective actions of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses. Word theories are not enough; we need mathematical theories. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the mathematical theories of learning and computation by neural systems. These theories use concepts from dynamical systems (attractors, oscillations, chaos) and concepts from statistics (information, uncertainty, inference) to relate the dynamics and functions of neural networks. We will apply these theories to sensory computation, learning and memory, and motor control. Students will learn to formalize and mathematically answer questions about neural computations, including “what does a network compute?”, “how does it compute?”, and “why does it compute that way?”
Prerequisites: knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics.

3931,"Description: In many applications one is faced with the task of simulating or controlling complex dynamical systems. Such applications include for instance, weather prediction, air quality management, VLSI chip design, molecular dynamics, active noise reduction, chemical reactors, etc. In all these cases complexity manifests itself as the number of first order differential equations which arise. Model (order) reduction (MOR) seeks to replace a large-scale system described in terms of differential or difference equations by a system of much lower dimension that has nearly the same response characteristics. The ensuing methods have been an indispensable tool for speeding up the simulations arising in various engineering applications involving large-scale dynamical systems.

4003,"Description: There is a long history of algorithmic development for solving inferential and estimation problems that play a central role in a variety of learning, sensing, and processing systems, including medical imaging scanners, numerous machine learning algorithms, and compressive sensing, to name just a few.  Until recently, most algorithms for solving inferential and estimation problems have iteratively applied static models derived from physics or intuition. In this course, we will explore a new approach that is based on “learning” various elements of the problem including i) stepsizes and parameters of iterative algorithms, ii) regularizers, and iii) inverse functions.  For example, we will explore a new approach for solving inverse problems that is based on transforming an iterative, physics-based algorithm into a deep network whose parameters can be learned from training data.  For a range of different inverse problems, deep networks have been shown to offer faster convergence to a better quality solution.  Specific topics to be discussed include:  Ill-posed inverse problems, iterative optimization, deep learning, neural networks, learning regularizers. This is a “reading course,” meaning that students will read and present classic and recent papers from the technical literature to the rest of the class in a lively debate format.  Discussions will aim at identifying common themes and important trends in the field.  Students will also get hands on experience with optimization problems and deep learning software through a group project.  Repeatable for Credit.

4006,"Description: This is a graduate seminar course on quantum information science and technology.  There is currently a world-wide effort to develop technologies based on the principles of quantum mechanics that are expected to revolutionize computation, communication, and sensing.  These rapid scientific and technological developments can be viewed as the second quantum revolution.  Unlike the first quantum revolution, which occurred during the first few decades of the 20th century and totally changed the way we describe the universe, the second quantum revolution is about controlling individual quantum systems to a much greater extent than before, enabling even more powerful applications of quantum mechanics.  Many of these new applications rely on genuinely quantum, nonintuitive concepts such as superposition and entanglement.  These concepts are becoming more and more common and important in diverse scientific disciplines beyond physics, including materials science, electrical engineering, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science.  We will review some of the latest published papers on quantum materials, devices, and systems, and their practical applications to quantum technologies.

Focusing on works from Octavia Butler to Victor Levalle, from George Schuyler to Mat Johnson, from John Williams to Colson Whitehead among others, the course engages the ways in which these authors represent the monstrous and grotesque; pandemics, environmental and technological degradation and catastrophe; urbanization, gentrification, and immigration; and (biological/technological) warfare, in order to recalibrate our understanding of the central role race plays in determining both access to, and allocation of, necessary resources.  We will track the histories and afterlives of slavery and colonialism that continue to transfigure our society, while also studying varied blueprints for, and critiques of, alternative, more egalitarian societies imagined by these artists.

Building on this understanding, a succinct tour of geologic history will help us paint a more complete picture of Earth’s climate variations and how they affected human evolution and history. With this context, we will be able to judge the anomalous character of recent climate change, establish its anthropogenic nature, and discuss solutions to the current climate crisis.

This course investigates the representation and perception of bodies, human and otherwise, in medieval visual culture by focusing on bodies that were thought to be “different.” Bodies carried with them hidden anatomical structures, marks of social and cultural status, and, in the eyes of the Church, the sin that came with human sexuality. How did artists and craftsmen make the body’s multiple meanings and messages intelligible in images? From diagrams in medical manuscripts to sculptures adorning cathedral façades to body-part-shaped liturgical vessels, bodies are everywhere in medieval visual culture. We will pair these images and objects with medieval texts offering period insights into the nature and meanings of bodies, and consider them through a contemporary theoretical lens. By focusing on approaches to representing bodily differences and attitudes toward perceived difference, this course will place special emphasis on how medieval ideas about gender, sexuality, and race found expression in art objects.

Why should we look at changing spaces over time to understand art history? How does the development of larger typologies of historical and visual evidence help us think through cultural questions?

4493,"Description: In the twentieth century, architects, scientists, engineers and technocrats attempted to free humanity from the constraints of nature ...and were met with developments in science and technology sufficient to do so. Tracking the late nineteenth and twentieth century techno-scientific impetus to re/design the shape of the future, from the level of genes to the scale of the built environment, this seminar combines investigations and theories of landscape, object oriented ontology, architecture and ecocriticism. 

In the first part of the course, we’ll unpack the history of modern agrilogistic thought, which projected empty, unoccupied space for opportunity and development onto otherwise occupied chromosomes, cultures and landscapes. The second section of this seminar traces the drive to order the biological world, using logics of efficiency and accountability, by rereading developments in energy, industry and resource development through the lens of object oriented ontology. Finally, we’ll reconsider developments in the plant, animal and human sciences which bolstered humanity’s twentieth century hubris, from the birth of genetics to the role radiation played in liberating plant breeding from the confines of Mendelian crosses.

4560,"Description: This seminar adopts a global approach to examine architecture and the built environment as sites of power, resistance, and coexistence. Through a series of case studies spanning the globe, from Central Asia to the Mediterranean to the Americas, we will explore how architectural works--monuments, buildings, urban plans, indigenous settlements, refugee camps--exercised authority, resisted domination, and/or created settings for coexistence. Topics to discuss include cross-cultural interactions in medieval Iberia (Spain/Portugal); Nineteenth-century Orientalist architecture and its discontents; the interwoven complexity of infrastructures, race, and gender in early twentieth century South America; the spaces and politics of U.S. assistance programs during the era of “development” across the Global South; and environmental diasporas and indigenous reclamations from the Amazon to Sub-Saharan Africa in present days.  Graduate students will submit an in-depth research proposal and paper and will give a formal presentation on their research paper in the seminar.

4565,"Description: In the twentieth century, architects, scientists, engineers and technocrats attempted to free humanity from the constraints of nature…and were met with developments in science and technology sufficient to do so. Tracking the late nineteenth- and twentieth-century techno-scientific impetus to re/design the shape of the future, from the level of genes to the scale of the built environment, this seminar combines investigations and theories of landscape, object-oriented ontology, architecture and ecocriticism. In the first part of the course, we’ll unpack the history of modern agrilogistic thought, which projected empty, unoccupied space for opportunity and development onto otherwise occupied chromosomes, cultures and landscapes. The second section of this seminar traces the drive to order the biological world, using logics of efficiency and accountability, by rereading developments in energy, industry and resource development through the lens of object oriented ontology. Finally, we’ll reconsider developments in the plant, animal and human sciences that bolstered humanity’s twentieth-century hubris, from the birth of genetics to the role radiation played in liberating plant breeding from the confines of Mendelian crosses. Graduate students will have six additional readings and extra presentations of the landscape and architecture projects. Graduate/Undergraduate Equivalency: HART 473.

Why should we look at changing spaces over time to understand art history? How does the development of larger typologies of historical and visual evidence help us think through cultural questions? Can we use an analysis of historical and contemporary viewership to understand both real and imagined spatial ideologies in art history and visual culture?

It covers the main events that shaped the region from the final years of the Ottoman empire, to the creation of the nation-states by Western colonialism, to the struggles for independence and decolonization.

4686,"Description: Science and technology studies in East Asia is an expanding, multidisciplinary field.  Sociologists, anthropologists, and philosophers have taken on questions of innovation and indigeneity to make sense of the parameters that define knowledge systems in Asia and the Global South.  As industrial centers in East Asia continue to intensify, so does a swelling sentiment to capture and maintain national and cultural legacies. What do histories of science and technology in East Asia look like?  What should they represent? To answer these questions, this course uses histories of scientific and technological artifacts to explore the boundaries between forms of knowledge and expertise that are both common and uncommon. Each week, we will pair an artifact or process with core literature from Science and Technology and Society (STS) studies to read again the grain and raise new historical questions. Rather than a comprehensive survey of scientific ideas alone, this course takes on histories of everyday objects and their practices to expand the scope of STS at large.

4723,"Description: We seem to find or make theater wherever we look. In halls and on stages, but also in Senate chambers and check-out lines - not to mention online. In the small rooms of houses and on small screens of reality television programming. Whether streaming or tweeting, drama is everywhere. What is drama such that it enjoys such intensity and ubiquity? Is it an overflow of energy that creates authenticity? An artificially heightened state (as in “too much drama”)? A carefully crafted manipulation (as in “political drama”)? A way of being in space? A cultural habit? This course considers why theater is so central to our idioms and cultural practices even for people who have never seen, much less set foot on, a proscenium stage. We’ll explore the many senses of drama central to social behavior by witnessing the long transit of theater from the classical amphitheater to just about anywhere. The course is designed to offer an introduction to the history and conventions of theatrical practice, from the ancient theater to 21st-century immersive and site-specific performance, which will offer a lens for understanding the drama of human interaction that spills out everywhere. Class sessions will include: 1) lecture/discussions about the histories of theater and languages of performance; 2) Learning Lab sessions that allow students to create their own personal theatrical experience with a combination of acting and directing exercises, live performance experiences, and conversations with theater professionals; and 3) theater of the everyday exercises inviting students to look at the world from the point of view of theatrical experience. No previous theater experience or training required. ",https://courses.rice.edu/courses/!SWKSCAT.cat?p_action=CATALIST&p_acyr_code=2022&p_crse_numb=121&p_subj=HUMA,N,1,Is All The World A Stage?
4724,"Description: “What is the ethical thing to do?” can be interpreted in various ways. What rules do ethical theories prescribe? What reasons can be given for and against different ethical theories? How have different ethical theories been developed – where do they come from? What binding force, if any, do ethical theories have? And, most importantly, how should we live? What does ethical reflection about our lives and our practices reveal? Students will be introduced to theoretical ethics and practical ethics. In Part One, roughly the first 8-9 weeks of the course, they will study classic works in philosophical ethics – and contemporary responses to them. They will learn philosophical arguments for and against these ethical theories. Guest lecturers will shed light on historical circumstances that led to their formation and on cross-cultural comparisons. In Part Two, roughly the last 6-7 weeks of the course, they will work through two topics in practical ethics: the treatment of animals and reparations for slavery. The course will conclude with an Ethics Lab, in which students work in small groups to gather information on a chosen topic in practical ethics and analyze it from the perspective of different ethical theories.

Thus, the philosophical material will be supplemented with poetry, film, literature, and personal essays from non-philosophers: material that will enrich their own thoughts as they try to determine the respect in which they agree or disagree with the philosophical perspectives on offer. One goal is to have the students recognize the extent to which philosophical reflection, and engaging with the humanities, can influence and deepen their perception and understanding of their lives.

4801,"Description: Though it is common for musical genres to be affiliated with nation-states, border-crossing diasporic music is in fact booming all around us. Bhangra, rai, jazz, klezmer, and many more point to longer histories and larger systems of transnational movement and social consciousness. In this course, we follow the music to explore the central place of diaspora in our world as well as the social critiques it offers. We ask two simultaneous questions: How does diaspora shape music? And what can music teach us about diaspora? Throughout the semester, we will listen to and read about Afro-diasporic music, music from the Jewish diaspora, the South Asian diaspora, “queer diaspora,” and beyond. Threaded together with broader materials from ethnomusicology, anthropology, cultural studies, and more, we explore key histories of border crossing that lead to modern diasporic formations, including the transatlantic African slave trade and colonialism. Critically analyzing musical questions such as tradition and hybridity leads us to examine diasporic approaches to themes of movement, borders, home, and identity, that challenge social systems of power. This course is designed to benefit and interest students from a wide range of disciplines and interests in the subject matter.

To get out of bed, lift objects, or clean our room, we need healthy range of motion around our joints. Over time, our inefficient habits of movement, and the decreased suppleness of muscle tissue that occurs naturally as we age can lead to reduced mobility of joints and compromised body positions. Staying active and stretching regularly reduces the chance of experiencing occasional and chronic musculoskeletal pain and helps prevent this loss of mobility. No previous experience is required and all fitness levels are welcome. ",https://courses.rice.edu/courses/!SWKSCAT.cat?p_action=CATALIST&p_acyr_code=2022&p_crse_numb=101&p_subj=LPAP,N,0,Stretch Lab

5180,"Description: As healthcare costs continue to rise at an alarming rate in U.S. over the past decade (about 20% of GDP by some accounts), issues relating cost measurement and management in the delivery of healthcare have also taken center stage. Experts in business and management have argued that extant cost systems do a poor job of measuring how much it costs to treat patients. Absent accurate measurement of these costs, many decisions could go wrong.  Cost management and efficiency initiatives would be misguided, and medical reimbursements would lack proper cost bases. These concerns have triggered advances in cost measurement and management techniques that are useful not just in the healthcare setting, but also in other service organizations. The purpose of this elective is to help students develop a critical understanding of the nature of costs in healthcare delivery, their measurement in a variety of decision contexts, and how they can be managed and improved. Students will be exposed to tools such as the break-even analysis, role of cost allocations, activity-based costing, time-driven activity based costing, and cost control.

5227,"Description: Professional service firms – consulting, money management, private equity, venture capital, advertising, medical service, and law firms – are confronted with significant challenges as they
experience increased competition from boutique firms as well as global and international competitors. Clients are more demanding, and there are significant, strategic and organizational
challenges which require different approaches from traditional approaches. One observer noted that this competition has moved from gentlemanly competition to a “blood sport”. Interestingly, the service sector in the US furnishes 68 percent of the GDP1 and this is growing in emerging economies; for example, the service sector in India contributed 56 percent to the GDP during 2008-09. Additionally, many of these firms’ leaders are overwhelmed by the expectation of a dual role where they are not only managers but also high profile producers. As such, it is important for a course to examine the strategy and leadership challenges these firms face and likewise to expose students to the challenges they will face as professionals in one of these organizations, and ultimately as leaders in such professional service firms. The course will also include visits from managers associated with professional service firms.

5233,"Description: This course focuses on the legal dimensions of entrepreneurship and is designed to help students develop the managerial capability to work effectively with legal counsel to solve complex problems and to protect and leverage firm resources. Like information technology, the legal dimensions of business should not be treated as an after-thought or add-on to the business strategy development process. Corporate leaders with an understanding of American law have a unique capacity to protect and enhance shareholder wealth. Conversely, managers who lack the ability to integrate law into the development of strategy can place the firm at a competitive disadvantage and imperil its economic viability. The overarching purpose of Legal Aspects of Entrepreneurship is to prepare students to meet the legal and regulatory challenges and opportunities they can expect to encounter as entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and managers of private and public businesses. The course provides a conceptual framework for understanding both the societal context within which businesses are organized and operate, as well as the various legal tools available to managers engaged in evaluating and pursuing opportunities. Legal Aspects of Entrepreneurship will offer strategies and tactics for working with counsel to use the law as a positive force to increase realizable value while managing the attendant risks and keeping the legal costs under control. The objective is not to teach business students how to think like lawyers, but rather to teach students how to become more legally astute so they can handle with confidence the legal aspects of entrepreneurship and management. This includes developing legal literacy and learning what to look for when selecting an attorney and knowing when to call one.

5390,"Description: This courses explores how we can be (or become) virtuous and successful leaders. This course helps students to develop personal and professional mission and values statements as aids in good leadership.  On the path to developing mission and values statements, students will explore elements of moral psychology and philosophy, emotional intelligence, character development, the formation of communal and personal identities, the purpose and practice of commercial activities from the vantage point of five spiritual traditions, practical examples of institutions applying missions and values (both successfully and unsuccessfully), ideas regarding meaning-making, measuring our success in life, creating a life purpose, and giving voice to our values. The question at the center of the course is whether we can live professional and personal lives that do not conflict, but rather work in concert with the economic dimensions of institutions, especially if we find ourselves leading others in these organizations.

5394,"Description: Truth, beauty and, yes, happiness, are issues that have engaged thoughtful people over the centuries. What is happiness (and what makes us happy)? Until recently we have relied on philosophers and religious thinkers for answers to that question, and many of them have provided useful recipes that seem to work for at least some people some of the time. The last century or so has seen many psychologists and self-help gurus who have also handed out (well, more often sold) recipes that generally seem to be less satisfactory than the wisdom of the ancients. Interestingly until recently psychologists have tended to ignore this seeming important topic, but in the past 10 or so years social and personality psychologists, neuroscientists and even economists have begun to pose empirically answerable questions about happiness and to find some data-based answers to what makes people happy. In this course we will read some of the traditional wisdom provided by religious and philosophical thinkers, but we will focus primarily on questions and issues that are subject to empirical resolution.

But other pieces from France, Germany, Russia, Spain, Hungary and England suggested that the future would present major changes. What did audiences in the United States know about such music? What did they think about it? What did the founders of the Rice Institute think about the new musical trends? How did the music played at the opening festivities of the Rice Institute reflect these perceptions of musical modernism?
