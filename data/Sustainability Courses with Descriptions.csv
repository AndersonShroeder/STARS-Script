The latest tools and techniques, however, raise questions about what counts as expertise, who controls access to information, what gets lost in translation, what power is likely to shift from educational institutions to profit-seeking companies, how the privileging of quantification and metrics affects humanistic wisdom, and how academic autonomy and diversity can ultimately be disrupted.

Thomas More’s original coinage, suggesting both “good place” and “no place,” might give little cause for hope, but that hasn’t stopped visionaries, scientists, artists and scholars from seeking it out over the years. It might be in our past, or just ahead. We might be there now, if only we knew how to look: under the pavement, we might find the beach. Or utopia might be off our planet entirely. Ideals shape societies; scientific research, architecture, city planning and cultural production all attest to the hopes and values that spawned them. But as we consider the fallout of past utopian efforts, corollary questions present themselves: do we even want to find utopia? Does every “perfect” society imply a dystopian counterpart? Who is utopia for, and who is excluded? This course will explore utopia through the work of scientists, architects, artists and art movements. Classes will fall into three categories: lectures and reading discussions; field trips; and group art projects.

Both anniversaries make it seem like the history of voting rights is a story of continually expanding suffrage. But the humanities can help students understand the more complex reality. Contests over “Who Should Vote?” have existed since the nation’s beginnings and continue today, as people argue over the prevalence of voter suppression or debate whether to lower the voting age. Studying historical contests over this “Big Question” is important because they illuminate the contingency of democracy. Democracy did not always mean the same thing to earlier Americans that it does to us. Moreover, expansions of the right to vote for some groups have often occurred hand in hand with new restrictions on voting for others. The history of suffrage is not one of unbroken progress or decline, but instead of continuous protest and political struggle. By exploring how earlier Americans fought over the answer to “Who Should Vote?"", students in this class will grapple with the meaning of American democracy itself.

This course addresses the construction and interpretation of financial statements. The goal of the course is not to train you to become an accountant. Rather, the course should equip you to become an informed user of financial statement information. Because annual reports are somewhat formidable, we will study how firms present the information for various accounts in their financial statements, including the footnotes. By the end of the course, you should have a basic understanding of financial statements and the ability to use them for decision making. Fulfillment of these objectives involves acquiring several skills. The course will emphasize (i) gaining familiarity with the types of transaction firms engage in, (ii) the mapping of transactions into accounting numbers, (iii) understanding the accounting-related choices that managers have for transactions and the rationale behind the various methods, (iv) developing fluency in accounting terminology, and (v) appreciating the complexity of accounting due to the (often considerable) discretion and judgment involved in choosing among alternative accounting methods, making estimates, and disclosing information in financial statements.",Management,2021-2022,,,,,,

This class will take a historical perspective on the relationship between science and modernity with a particular focus on music—a topic which has puzzled philosophers for millennia, and one which poses special problems for the modes of knowledge that characterize scientific modernity. Is music a “universal language”? Why does music so powerfully affect our emotions? Why are some sounds pleasing and others are not? Our goal in this class is to explore what scientific approaches to these questions can tell us about the place of science in the modern world—as well as how and why science has become so important to our imagining of ourselves as thinking, feeling, and willing beings. Armed with this historical knowledge, we will also read recent examples of popular science writing on sound and music a way to think about how we can we become better consumers of scientific knowledge as it is disseminated in the public sphere.

We explore the way that colonial geographies imprint geographies of toxicity and the ways that capitalism and consumption produce and distribute toxicity. In relation to health, we explore the ways that the materiality and biology of toxic exposure are embodied in specific ways that undermine singular or universalizable concepts and measures of human and environmental health and require us to think about the health in relation to the specificities of race, class, gender, disability, and intimacy in particular places and times. In relation to sovereignty, we explore the ways that the promiscuous movement of toxicants provokes but also eludes regulations that hew to the ridged boundaries of law and territory and raise new questions of accountability and evidence.

We explore the way that colonial geographies imprint geographies of toxicity and the ways that capitalism and consumption produce and distribute toxicity. In relation to health, we explore the ways that the materiality and biology of toxic exposure are embodied in specific ways that undermine singular or universalizable concepts and measures of human and environmental health and require us to think about the health in relation to the specificities of race, class, gender, disability, and intimacy in particular places and times. In relation to sovereignty, we explore the ways that the promiscuous movement of toxicants provokes but also eludes regulations that hew to the ridged boundaries of law and territory and raise new questions of accountability and evidence.

Micro-surveys of Mario Montez’s and Dorothy Dean’s appearances in the films will be closely tracked. In the course, we will examine Warhol’s career as a key recent shift from modernism’s medium-specificity to “contemporary art” as context—a situation the films pull into sharp focus, given, as Mike Kelley wrote, the “current collapse of the historical differentiation between fine art and the entertainment industry.” For graduate students, the viewing journal is also necessary, but there are three additional requirements: a) a 20 to 25-page essay; b) a short presentation to the class; and c) the additional reading of Warhol's diaries.

Game theory has a wide range of applications in economics, political science, but most importantly (in my opinion) business. The approach of this course will be somewhere between that of a typical economics class (i.e. very mathematical) and that of a typical business seminar (applied and paper based.) Definitions will be stated formally, and arguments will be developed rigorously. At the same time, much of the course will be devoted to using game theory to understand applications in economics and business. Taking these applications as a starting point, we will develop an understanding of what constitutes a good mathematical model for addressing a business question.

Also its athletic presence has been augmenting as an Olympic sport and large global championships as fencing has proved to be more than just sword fights with its complex technicality and mental strategies.
While most sports do incorporate mental strategies into performance, fencing integrates these mental knowledge into performance simultaneously with body movements. How does this dual integration of psychological strategies and physical movements in fencing differentiate from other sports? In this course, students will go over fundamental principles of fencing, compare different types and rules of fencing, and discuss mental strategies along with the physical strategies observed in Olympic games that influence an individual's performance. Students will also be able to try practical tactics and styles in fencing and have a chance to attend one of Rice Fencing Club practices if social distancing regulations ameliorate.

Throughout the semester, we will approach both queer and media studies with an eagerness to learn, embracing both queer joy and pain in our effort. While we will draw on a variety of materials and global perspectives, queer studies is a vast field, and the course will primarily focus on the LGBTQ+ community in the United States.

This modern day origami renaissance has been closely connected to advances in science, technology, and computational mathematics combined with artistic intuition and creativity. How can mathematical methods be applied to develop awesome, creative origami with a purpose? The practice of origami sekkei, or technical origami design, overthrows the traditional freestyle folding process and instead turns to a carefully engineered theoretical model. Students will explore contributions from the pioneers of modern origami, ranging from the fantastically intricate work of NASA physicist Robert J. Lang to the elegant simplicity of origami grandmaster Kiyo Yoshizawa. The course will cover mathematical techniques such as base folding, grafting, circle packing, tree theory, and box pleating through hands-on, interactive exercises. Starting with the very basics, this course is designed to be approachable to beginners in all aspects but also offers topics that may be of additional interest for those in specialized fields of study. Overall, we hope to unfold the mysteries of origami and turn the page to reveal some of the most cutting-edge work in the field. ",,2021-2022,,,,,,

Historically, the cultivation and spread of tea can be used to illustrate the roots of trade, cultural diffusion, and the development of globalization. With the global tea market being worth an estimated 200 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, contemporary tea production has an astonishing economic and environmental impact in countries such as China and India. Encapsulated in this context is a fine dining tea culture built upon
the scientific and sensory evaluation of tea. This class aims to delve into these issues, all while acquainting students with formal tea tasting and grading techniques. Guided by weekly tea tastings, a field trip to a local tea house, and interactive history lessons, we will be asking the following key questions: How has tea impacted the economic and political development in history? What role do current tea production and labor practices have in climate change, political unrest, and social justice? How can one develop their senses to assess dry and brewed tea? Altogether, this class strives to turn the casual tea-drinking student into a master tea sommelier by asking the following overarching inquiry: What does it mean to be a conscious and knowledgeable tea consumer in practice?""

Unfortunately, when learning these methods, many beginners prioritize brute-force algorithm memorization over an intuitive understanding of twisty puzzle behavior and why these algorithms accomplish what they claim to do. Although advanced solution methods indeed are heavily reliant on algorithm memorization, learning introductory solution methods in this way will lead to rapid decay of their mastery. Thus, how does an intuitive understanding of twisty puzzles affect the long-term learning and application of their solution methods? In this course, students will learn the mathematical basis of twisty puzzle behavior, predominant methods of solving the Rubik’s Cube (3x3) and Rubik’s Revenge (4x4), and ways of constructing solves and critiquing their efficiency. Students should expect to spend time each week practicing solves of the 3x3 and 4x4, commentating on the choices they make to solve increasingly large portions of these puzzles.

Do you think investing is for the old and wealthy? With the increasing precarity surrounding us, it is more important than ever to set yourself up for financial success. There is a common misconception in investing that you need a lot of money to get started. That is certainly not true anymore. All it takes is a plan. Learning how to invest is a skill that everyone can make use of. 
In this class, you will learn the basics of investing and account management. We will cover what the stock market is, how to invest, what stocks to pick, how to hedge, and the importance of investing your money. Starting to prepare for YOUR financial future is a luxury that many people wished they started doing in their early 20s. Over time, you will be able to generate more money through passive income than through a traditional office job, and this will be illustrated by the power of compound interest. We will discuss your needs as an individual financially and come up with an effective plan to meet those needs. We will also discuss something many mathematicians and investors have long debated – does technical analysis work? What are its limits, and when can you use it? Why should and why should it not work? By the end of the class, you will have the tools required to manage your own portfolio effectively and plan for your future and retirement.

Mental illness is defined as health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination of these). Stigma towards mental health largely takes the shape of societal disapproval of those with mental illness or who desire to discuss mental health in their communities. In this course, we will cover common stigmas related to discussing mental health and approaching mental illness. We will also examine how we may have implicit bias against people with mental illness or even against discussing mental health in general and how we can work to address those biases. This course will also look at various coping strategies used by individuals struggling with mental health and introduce positive practices to discuss mental health. ",,2021-2022,,,,,,

This movement, known as the Jewish Diaspora, led to the development of numerous ethnic divisions within the Jewish culture, such as the Ashkenazi, the Sephardic, and more. The global migration of the Jewish people has led to separate religious practices and cultural diversity within the religion. However, holiday celebrations have served as a bridge to unite Jews from different backgrounds through shared rituals, prayer, and, most importantly, food. Therefore, throughout this class, students will examine: why does food play such a central role in Jewish holidays? To investigate this, students will learn about the historical background and symbolism behind classic Jewish holiday cuisine. At the end of each lecture, students will participate in a Kahoot quiz to test their knowledge of the historical significance and symbolism of each holiday and its food. The following week, everyone will participate in a hands-on cooking tutorial based on the previous in-class lecture, allowing students to foster their interest and appreciation for unfamiliar cultures. At the end of the course, students will be expected to prepare a traditional Jewish holiday food of their choice and examine how food impacts their own holiday celebrations. ",,2021-2022,,,,,,

In this course, students will disconnect themselves from the outside world of technology, social media, and distractions for 1 hour a week, looking inwards to find the root causes of the uneasiness in oneself. Students will work on meditation, journaling, self-care, and other research-backed methods. They will learn to be stiller, observe their emotions more, and more easily identify the best actions to aid their mental health when faced with stressors.

However, they are an entirely unique visual and aural route to engage with ideas on human nature itself. A film like Parasite indicates the potential that they have to make mainstream splashes. Watching art cinema can and should be an entirely exciting experience.

As a result, it is more important than ever to ensure that programs function correctly and cannot be exploited by hostile adversaries. The field of formal methods takes on this challenge, developing algorithms and programming methodologies that can be used to formally reason about what happens when software executes on arbitrary inputs, often without actually executing the program. Such reasoning can be used, for example, to identify subtle bugs and vulnerabilities in programs, or to give mathematical proofs of program correctness. This is a hands-on introduction to the field of formal methods.

1.	Computational Geophysics
2.	Reservoir Simulation Fundamentals
3.	Machine Learning
The first two components will be taught together in the first 10 weeks by dedicating half of the class-time to each subject. The Machine Learning component will, in part, build on the first two fundamental components and will be taught using the full class time.
Computational Geophysics
The participants in this geophysics part of the course are expected to be interested into learn how to use modern seismic data to image the subsurface with awareness of the computational costs of the techniques involved. The main focus will be given to current seismic imaging tools including cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) applications. As the result of the successful completion of this course part, the course participants should be able to: (1) Understand the context and value of imaging tools for the hydrocarbon exploration business. (2) Relate the imaging tools with their computational costs for modern computer resources. (3) Properly use wave-based geophysical imaging and ML-based tools and (4) Understand main seismic processing and interpretation decisions.
Applied Reservoir Simulation
This component of the course will introduce participants to the practice of reservoir simulation. This class will be an applied course on reservoir simulation. Theoretical descriptions will be provided as warranted but will be kept to minimum. Class participants will learn about the fundamentals of applied reservoir simulation, use of a reservoir simulator, and how to select the proper model for a simulation study. This course will also cover data preparation, grid design, calibration of the reservoir model, forecasting of future performance, and interpretation of simulation results. Participants will also be introduced to the role of simulation in reservoir management, limitations of reservoir simulation, and the structural aspects of the models. Upscaling and recent advances simulation techniques will also be discussed. A realistic open-source reservoir simulation software will be used during the tutorials and computer projects.
Machine Learning for Oil & Gas
This part of the course will introduce the fundamentals of statistical learning, present a few of the popular learning paradigms and algorithms, and culminate in a small student project applying them to an oil reservoir data set using the R programming language (solutions to class problems will be accepted in any programming language or system). Much of the material presented here is also known under the names “Big Data”, “Data Analytics”, “Artificial Intelligence”, “Data Mining”, “Petroleum Data Driven Analytics” and other terms. Weeks 11 and 12 are theory only, weeks 13-15 will have small hands-on exercises incorporated and week 16 and 17 are dedicated to solving a simple oil reservoir problem using machine learning.

Such applications include for instance, weather prediction, air quality management, VLSI chip design, molecular dynamics, active noise reduction, chemical reactors, etc. In all these cases complexity manifests itself as the number of first order differential equations which arise. Model (order) reduction (MOR) seeks to replace a large-scale system described in terms of differential or difference equations by a system of much lower dimension that has nearly the same response characteristics. The ensuing methods have been an indispensable tool for speeding up the simulations arising in various engineering applications involving large-scale dynamical systems.

Until recently, most algorithms for solving inferential and estimation problems have iteratively applied static models derived from physics or intuition. In this course, we will explore a new approach that is based on “learning” various elements of the problem including i) stepsizes and parameters of iterative algorithms, ii) regularizers, and iii) inverse functions.  For example, we will explore a new approach for solving inverse problems that is based on transforming an iterative, physics-based algorithm into a deep network whose parameters can be learned from training data.  For a range of different inverse problems, deep networks have been shown to offer faster convergence to a better quality solution.  Specific topics to be discussed include:  Ill-posed inverse problems, iterative optimization, deep learning, neural networks, learning regularizers. This is a “reading course,” meaning that students will read and present classic and recent papers from the technical literature to the rest of the class in a lively debate format.  Discussions will aim at identifying common themes and important trends in the field.  Students will also get hands on experience with optimization problems and deep learning software through a group project.  Repeatable for Credit. ",,2021-2022,,,,,,

There is currently a world-wide effort to develop technologies based on the principles of quantum mechanics that are expected to revolutionize computation, communication, and sensing.  These rapid scientific and technological developments can be viewed as the second quantum revolution.  Unlike the first quantum revolution, which occurred during the first few decades of the 20th century and totally changed the way we describe the universe, the second quantum revolution is about controlling individual quantum systems to a much greater extent than before, enabling even more powerful applications of quantum mechanics.  Many of these new applications rely on genuinely quantum, nonintuitive concepts such as superposition and entanglement.  These concepts are becoming more and more common and important in diverse scientific disciplines beyond physics, including materials science, electrical engineering, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science.  We will review some of the latest published papers on quantum materials, devices, and systems, and their practical applications to quantum technologies.

After briefly reviewing Earth’s composition and its fluid envelopes, we will cover the basic physics of the climate system, providing tools to understand weather and climate phenomena (e.g. monsoons, El Niño), the greenhouse effect, and climate feedbacks. Building on this understanding, a succinct tour of geologic history will help us paint a more complete picture of Earth’s climate variations and how they affected human evolution and history. With this context, we will be able to judge the anomalous character of recent climate change, establish its anthropogenic nature, and discuss solutions to the current climate crisis. Students from any major are encouraged to enroll and engage on important topic. ",,2021-2022,,,,,,

How did artists and craftsmen make the body’s multiple meanings and messages intelligible in images? From diagrams in medical manuscripts to sculptures adorning cathedral façades to body-part-shaped liturgical vessels, bodies are everywhere in medieval visual culture. We will pair these images and objects with medieval texts offering period insights into the nature and meanings of bodies, and consider them through a contemporary theoretical lens.

What is it about the modern period that accounts for this shift in how monstrosity is represented and understood and how does it differ from earlier historical images of the monster? This class will examine the modernist fascination with monstrosity, asking why it became a topic of such interest to artists, writers, and filmmakers during this time, and what it can tell us about modernist aesthetics more broadly. Examining a range of representations from the 18th century on, we will look at visual artists, filmmakers, and novelists who depict various forms of monsters, be they human (Jack the Ripper) or non-human (the Golem). From Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and the myth of the vampire, to Picasso’s monstrous images of 1920s, to the distinctly modern phenomenon of serial killing, this course will chart the dark monstrous underside to modern art. Graduate students will be required to give two twenty-minute presentations in class, and write two papers, one short (10-12 pages) and one long (20-30 pages).

To answer these questions, this course uses histories of scientific and technological artifacts to explore the boundaries between forms of knowledge and expertise that are both common and uncommon. Each week, we will pair an artifact or process with core literature from Science and Technology and Society (STS) studies to read again the grain and raise new historical questions.

In halls and on stages, but also in Senate chambers and check-out lines - not to mention online. In the small rooms of houses and on small screens of reality television programming. Whether streaming or tweeting, drama is everywhere. What is drama such that it enjoys such intensity and ubiquity? Is it an overflow of energy that creates authenticity? An artificially heightened state (as in “too much drama”)? A carefully crafted manipulation (as in “political drama”)? A way of being in space? A cultural habit? This course considers why theater is so central to our idioms and cultural practices even for people who have never seen, much less set foot on, a proscenium stage. We’ll explore the many senses of drama central to social behavior by witnessing the long transit of theater from the classical amphitheater to just about anywhere. The course is designed to offer an introduction to the history and conventions of theatrical practice, from the ancient theater to 21st-century immersive and site-specific performance, which will offer a lens for understanding the drama of human interaction that spills out everywhere. Class sessions will include: 1) lecture/discussions about the histories of theater and languages of performance; 2) Learning Lab sessions that allow students to create their own personal theatrical experience with a combination of acting and directing exercises, live performance experiences, and conversations with theater professionals; and 3) theater of the everyday exercises inviting students to look at the world from the point of view of theatrical experience. No previous theater experience or training required. ",,2021-2022,,,,,,

What rules do ethical theories prescribe? What reasons can be given for and against different ethical theories? How have different ethical theories been developed – where do they come from? What binding force, if any, do ethical theories have? And, most importantly, how should we live? What does ethical reflection about our lives and our practices reveal? Students will be introduced to theoretical ethics and practical ethics. In Part One, roughly the first 8-9 weeks of the course, they will study classic works in philosophical ethics – and contemporary responses to them. They will learn philosophical arguments for and against these ethical theories. Guest lecturers will shed light on historical circumstances that led to their formation and on cross-cultural comparisons. In Part Two, roughly the last 6-7 weeks of the course, they will work through two topics in practical ethics: the treatment of animals and reparations for slavery. The course will conclude with an Ethics Lab, in which students work in small groups to gather information on a chosen topic in practical ethics and analyze it from the perspective of different ethical theories.

Thus, the philosophical material will be supplemented with poetry, film, literature, and personal essays from non-philosophers: material that will enrich their own thoughts as they try to determine the respect in which they agree or disagree with the philosophical perspectives on offer. One goal is to have the students recognize the extent to which philosophical reflection, and engaging with the humanities, can influence and deepen their perception and understanding of their lives.

Bhangra, rai, jazz, klezmer, and many more point to longer histories and larger systems of transnational movement and social consciousness. In this course, we follow the music to explore the central place of diaspora in our world as well as the social critiques it offers. We ask two simultaneous questions: How does diaspora shape music? And what can music teach us about diaspora? Throughout the semester, we will listen to and read about Afro-diasporic music, music from the Jewish diaspora, the South Asian diaspora, “queer diaspora,” and beyond. Threaded together with broader materials from ethnomusicology, anthropology, cultural studies, and more, we explore key histories of border crossing that lead to modern diasporic formations, including the transatlantic African slave trade and colonialism. Critically analyzing musical questions such as tradition and hybridity leads us to examine diasporic approaches to themes of movement, borders, home, and identity, that challenge social systems of power.

Experts in business and management have argued that extant cost systems do a poor job of measuring how much it costs to treat patients. Absent accurate measurement of these costs, many decisions could go wrong.  Cost management and efficiency initiatives would be misguided, and medical reimbursements would lack proper cost bases. These concerns have triggered advances in cost measurement and management techniques that are useful not just in the healthcare setting, but also in other service organizations. The purpose of this elective is to help students develop a critical understanding of the nature of costs in healthcare delivery, their measurement in a variety of decision contexts, and how they can be managed and improved.

experience increased competition from boutique firms as well as global and international competitors. Clients are more demanding, and there are significant, strategic and organizational
challenges which require different approaches from traditional approaches. One observer noted that this competition has moved from gentlemanly competition to a “blood sport”. Interestingly, the service sector in the US furnishes 68 percent of the GDP1 and this is growing in emerging economies; for example, the service sector in India contributed 56 percent to the GDP during 2008-09. Additionally, many of these firms’ leaders are overwhelmed by the expectation of a dual role where they are not only managers but also high profile producers. As such, it is important for a course to examine the strategy and leadership challenges these firms face and likewise to expose students to the challenges they will face as professionals in one of these organizations, and ultimately as leaders in such professional service firms. The course will also include visits from managers associated with professional service firms.

Like information technology, the legal dimensions of business should not be treated as an after-thought or add-on to the business strategy development process. Corporate leaders with an understanding of American law have a unique capacity to protect and enhance shareholder wealth. Conversely, managers who lack the ability to integrate law into the development of strategy can place the firm at a competitive disadvantage and imperil its economic viability. The overarching purpose of Legal Aspects of Entrepreneurship is to prepare students to meet the legal and regulatory challenges and opportunities they can expect to encounter as entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and managers of private and public businesses. The course provides a conceptual framework for understanding both the societal context within which businesses are organized and operate, as well as the various legal tools available to managers engaged in evaluating and pursuing opportunities. Legal Aspects of Entrepreneurship will offer strategies and tactics for working with counsel to use the law as a positive force to increase realizable value while managing the attendant risks and keeping the legal costs under control. The objective is not to teach business students how to think like lawyers, but rather to teach students how to become more legally astute so they can handle with confidence the legal aspects of entrepreneurship and management. This includes developing legal literacy and learning what to look for when selecting an attorney and knowing when to call one.

However, many of these situations - particularly those involving uncertainty and/or complex interactions - may be too difficult to grasp intuitively, and the stakes may be too high to learn by experience. This course introduces spreadsheet modeling, simulation, decision analysis and optimization to represent and analyze such complex problems. The skills learned in this course are applicable in almost all aspects of business and should be helpful in future courses. The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we discuss the use of decision trees for structuring decision problems under uncertainty. In the second part of the course, we discuss Monte Carlo simulation, a technique for simulating complex, uncertain systems.

The last century or so has seen many psychologists and self-help gurus who have also handed out (well, more often sold) recipes that generally seem to be less satisfactory than the wisdom of the ancients. Interestingly until recently psychologists have tended to ignore this seeming important topic, but in the past 10 or so years social and personality psychologists, neuroscientists and even economists have begun to pose empirically answerable questions about happiness and to find some data-based answers to what makes people happy.
