Thomas More’s original coinage, suggesting both “good place” and “no place,” might give little cause for hope, but that hasn’t stopped visionaries, scientists, artists and scholars from seeking it out over the years. It might be in our past, or just ahead. We might be there now, if only we knew how to look: under the pavement, we might find the beach. Or utopia might be off our planet entirely. Ideals shape societies; scientific research, architecture, city planning and cultural production all attest to the hopes and values that spawned them. But as we consider the fallout of past utopian efforts, corollary questions present themselves: do we even want to find utopia? Does every “perfect” society imply a dystopian counterpart? Who is utopia for, and who is excluded? This course will explore utopia through the work of scientists, architects, artists and art movements. Classes will fall into three categories: lectures and reading discussions; field trips; and group art projects. These latter Learning Lab projects will encourage students to work together and apply the readings, discussions and artistic precedents towards their own visions of utopia. \\n\\nBased on this course description does this class promote sustainability? \\n                    Please assess it with a 1 (sustainable) or 0 (not sustainable) and provide a one sentence explanation why.\\n                    The format should be 1 or 0: (Reasoning) (newline)', 'A course description is provided below:\\n\\nIn 2020, Americans will celebrate the centennial of the Nineteenth Amendment and the sesquicentennial of the Fifteenth Amendment. Both anniversaries make it seem like the history of voting rights is a story of continually expanding suffrage. But the humanities can help students understand the more complex reality. Contests over “Who Should Vote?” have existed since the nation’s beginnings and continue today, as people argue over the prevalence of voter suppression or debate whether to lower the voting age. Studying historical contests over this “Big Question” is important because they illuminate the contingency of democracy. Democracy did not always mean the same thing to earlier Americans that it does to us. Moreover, expansions of the right to vote for some groups have often occurred hand in hand with new restrictions on voting for others. The history of suffrage is not one of unbroken progress or decline, but instead of continuous protest and political struggle. By exploring how earlier Americans fought over the answer to “Who Should Vote?\", students in this class will grapple with the meaning of American democracy itself.  \\n\\nBased on this course description does this class promote sustainability? \\n                    Please assess it with a 1 (sustainable) or 0 (not sustainable) and provide a one sentence explanation why.\\n                    The format should be 1 or 0: (Reasoning) (newline)', \"A course description is provided below:\\n\\nThis course will engage students with three questions: WHO is Disney (as an artist and as an entrepreneur and creator of iconic figures and films)?

Hate can be an emotion, an action, a belief, an ideology. It can manifest itself with great passion, or become normalized so that it isn’t even recognized as such –perhaps seen, instead, as an expression of “how things are.” This course gathers strands from diverse disciplines, in order to present a cohesive examination of “hate as a system” undermining civic life, and even the cultural and intellectual vitality of society. We will examine the unsettling question of “hatred” through scholarly works, literary expressions, and visual culture dealing with prejudice, discrimination, extreme nationalistic movements, racism, and genocide. Along with these academic and artistic explorations, we will advance into the realm of engaged humanities and activism, through a series of presentations by scholars and advocates.

Rather, the course should equip you to become an informed user of financial statement information. Because annual reports are somewhat formidable, we will study how firms present the information for various accounts in their financial statements, including the footnotes. By the end of the course, you should have a basic understanding of financial statements and the ability to use them for decision making. Fulfillment of these objectives involves acquiring several skills. The course will emphasize (i) gaining familiarity with the types of transaction firms engage in, (ii) the mapping of transactions into accounting numbers, (iii) understanding the accounting-related choices that managers have for transactions and the rationale behind the various methods, (iv) developing fluency in accounting terminology, and (v) appreciating the complexity of accounting due to the (often considerable) discretion and judgment involved in choosing among alternative accounting methods, making estimates, and disclosing information in financial statements.\\n\\nBased on this course description does this class promote sustainability? \\n                    Please assess it with a 1 (sustainable) or 0 (not sustainable) and provide a one sentence explanation why.\\n                    The format should be 1 or 0: (Reasoning) (newline)', 'A course description is provided below:\\n\\nThe course provides an introduction to accounting systems that managers use to support decision making and to align behaviors.

This class will take a historical perspective on the relationship between science and modernity with a particular focus on music—a topic which has puzzled philosophers for millennia, and one which poses special problems for the modes of knowledge that characterize scientific modernity. Is music a “universal language”? Why does music so powerfully affect our emotions? Why are some sounds pleasing and others are not? Our goal in this class is to explore what scientific approaches to these questions can tell us about the place of science in the modern world—as well as how and why science has become so important to our imagining of ourselves as thinking, feeling, and willing beings. Armed with this historical knowledge, we will also read recent examples of popular science writing on sound and music a way to think about how we can we become better consumers of scientific knowledge as it is disseminated in the public sphere.

Understanding the brain requires sophisticated theories to make sense of the collective actions of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses. Word theories are not enough; we need mathematical theories. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the mathematical theories of learning and computation by neural systems. These theories use concepts from dynamical systems (attractors, oscillations, chaos) and concepts from statistics (information, uncertainty, inference) to relate the dynamics and functions of neural networks. We will apply these theories to sensory computation, learning and memory, and motor control. Students will learn to formalize and mathematically answer questions about neural computations, including “what does a network compute?”, “how does it compute?”, and “why does it compute that way?” Prerequisites: knowledge of calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics.

As shipping and logistics have emerged as defining features of contemporary global exchange, ships have acquired new forms and functions.
