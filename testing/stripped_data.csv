In this class, our aim is to ask a) what is historically and materially distinct about genetic information as a metaphor for social processes, b) how is the value of life itself being reproduced and transformed for whom, and c) what are potential consequences we face by relating to one another through the geneticization of social life?"

Students are expected to read extensively, to be prepared to discuss topics of urbanism in class, to form two-person teams to read selected texts to be presented in class and to shape a term project that may take the form of a final paper or a design proposal dealing with suburban issues. Grades are based on class participation, the reading project and the term project."

We will interpret the historical sources, contexts, and problems of this watershed moment and investigate the problems by political, philosophical, literary, and visual documents regarding the pre-revolutionary status quo, the transformation of political liberty into repressive terror, worldwide warfare, and ideological struggle. The course will focus on historical contexts such as the influence of the Enlightenment; the emergence of citizenship and human rights; the development of social spectacles and the public sphere; the Reign of Terror and the regression to Tyranny; emancipationist discourses (the abolition of slavery, colonial revolt, radical feminism); and the contradictory figure of Napoleon. We will consider, finally, how the Revolution has come to be viewed, both within France and without, considering its many aftershocks and reverberations up until the present day. "

Thomas More’s original coinage, suggesting both “good place” and “no place,” might give little cause for hope, but that hasn’t stopped visionaries, scientists, artists and scholars from seeking it out over the years. It might be in our past, or just ahead. We might be there now, if only we knew how to look: under the pavement, we might find the beach. Or utopia might be off our planet entirely. Ideals shape societies; scientific research, architecture, city planning and cultural production all attest to the hopes and values that spawned them. But as we consider the fallout of past utopian efforts, corollary questions present themselves: do we even want to find utopia? Does every “perfect” society imply a dystopian counterpart? Who is utopia for, and who is excluded? This course will explore utopia through the work of scientists, architects, artists and art movements. Classes will fall into three categories: lectures and reading discussions; field trips; and group art projects. These latter Learning Lab projects will encourage students to work together and apply the readings, discussions and artistic precedents towards their own visions of utopia. "

Both anniversaries make it seem like the history of voting rights is a story of continually expanding suffrage. But the humanities can help students understand the more complex reality. Contests over “Who Should Vote?” have existed since the nation’s beginnings and continue today, as people argue over the prevalence of voter suppression or debate whether to lower the voting age. Studying historical contests over this “Big Question” is important because they illuminate the contingency of democracy. Democracy did not always mean the same thing to earlier Americans that it does to us. Moreover, expansions of the right to vote for some groups have often occurred hand in hand with new restrictions on voting for others. The history of suffrage is not one of unbroken progress or decline, but instead of continuous protest and political struggle. By exploring how earlier Americans fought over the answer to “Who Should Vote?"", students in this class will grapple with the meaning of American democracy itself.  "

Hate can be an emotion, an action, a belief, an ideology. It can manifest itself with great passion, or become normalized so that it isn’t even recognized as such –perhaps seen, instead, as an expression of “how things are.” This course gathers strands from diverse disciplines, in order to present a cohesive examination of “hate as a system” undermining civic life, and even the cultural and intellectual vitality of society. We will examine the unsettling question of “hatred” through scholarly works, literary expressions, and visual culture dealing with prejudice, discrimination, extreme nationalistic movements, racism, and genocide. Along with these academic and artistic explorations, we will advance into the realm of engaged humanities and activism, through a series of presentations by scholars and advocates.

The skills learned in this course are applicable in almost all aspects of business and should be helpful in future courses. The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we discuss the use of decision trees for structuring decision problems under uncertainty. In the second part of the course, we discuss Monte Carlo simulation, a technique for simulating complex, uncertain systems.

This class will take a historical perspective on the relationship between science and modernity with a particular focus on music—a topic which has puzzled philosophers for millennia, and one which poses special problems for the modes of knowledge that characterize scientific modernity. Is music a “universal language”? Why does music so powerfully affect our emotions? Why are some sounds pleasing and others are not? Our goal in this class is to explore what scientific approaches to these questions can tell us about the place of science in the modern world—as well as how and why science has become so important to our imagining of ourselves as thinking, feeling, and willing beings. Armed with this historical knowledge, we will also read recent examples of popular science writing on sound and music a way to think about how we can we become better consumers of scientific knowledge as it is disseminated in the public sphere.
